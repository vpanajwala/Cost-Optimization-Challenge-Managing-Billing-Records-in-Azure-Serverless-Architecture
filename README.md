# Cost-Optimization-Challenge-Managing-Billing-Records-in-Azure-Serverless-Architecture
Problem Statement

We are using Azure Cosmos DB to store billing records in a serverless architecture. Due to a large and growing number of read-heavy records (over 2 million, each up to 300KB), storage costs have significantly increased. However, records older than 3 months are rarely accessed. We need a cost-effective, seamless archival solution that ensures no data loss or downtime and does not require API changes.

Proposed Solution
Architecture Overview
We propose a tiered data storage approach:
1. Hot Data (<=3 months): Stored in Azure Cosmos DB
2. Cold Data (>3 months): Moved to Azure Blob Storage (Hot or Cool tier depending on frequency of access)
3. Data Access Layer: Azure Function with routing logic
4. Durable Queue: Azure Storage Queue to manage archival jobs asynchronousl

Key Benefits
Simplicity: Easy to implement using Azure native services
No Downtime: Asynchronous archival ensures no service interruption
No API Contract Changes: Routing logic is encapsulated within the existing data access function
Cost Reduction: Blob Storage (Cool/Archive tiers) is significantly cheaper than Cosmos DB

# Azure Billing Record Cost Optimization

This repo provides an implementation plan and scripts for archiving old billing records from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Blob Storage.

## Components
- Durable Function for Archiving
- Azure Function for Read Access
- Terraform/Bash for infrastructure setup

## Features
- Maintains existing API contracts
- Ensures no downtime
- Reduces storage costs significantly

## Usage
1. Deploy storage account and blob container
2. Deploy archival function with timer trigger
3. Modify read logic in the data access function
4. Monitor with Application Insights
